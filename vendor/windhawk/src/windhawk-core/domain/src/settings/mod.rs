//! Initial-settings extraction: the `==WindhawkModSettings==` YAML block,
//! validated against the same schema the TS implementation enforces with
//! jsonschema, then transformed with `$name`/`$description`/`$options`
//! language selection.
//!
//! Split into single-concern submodules, all driven by the
//! `extract_initial_settings_inner` orchestrator in this root:
//! - `extract`: the source-scan helpers (the mod `@id`/`@version` read that
//!   keys the workarounds; the block extraction itself is `crate::scan`).
//! - `workarounds`: the per-(mod id, version) pre-parse string fixups.
//! - `marker`: the `#!` spelling of the annotations, a pre-parse text pass
//!   plus the second reading of a marked block and its comparison.
//! - `nesting`: the pre-load bound on how deep the document nests.
//! - `aliases`: the pre-load bound on YAML alias expansion.
//! - `validate`: the schema validator.
//! - `transform`: the YAML -> typed-tree transformer.
//! - `conditions`: the `$showIf` / `$hideIf` reference resolver, on the
//!   typed tree.
//! - `flatten`: the engine name->value flattener.
//!
//! `scalar_key_to_string`, `parse_annotation_key` and `float_literal` are the
//! helpers genuinely shared between the validate and transform passes, so they
//! live here in the root (one home, not a copy per submodule).
//!
//! Validation and transformation run directly over the parsed YAML tree
//! (yaml-rust2 keeps mapping keys in insertion order), so annotation grouping
//! and language fallback see keys in the same order the JS object did. The two
//! passes are kept SEPARATE (not merged into one producing pass):
//! error-detection order is observable (the first-error message rides in
//! `parseModSource`'s result), and one pass would change which error fires
//! first. The full parse-don't-validate merge is the deferred stretch.
//!
//! Numbers are restricted to int32-ranged integers (see
//! `validate::validate_number`): Windhawk stores settings as 32-bit values -
//! the `SettingsBackend` `set_int` takes an `i32`, REG_DWORD in registry mode -
//! and has no floating-point storage, so a YAML float (`1.0`, `1.5`, `1e3`,
//! `.inf`) or an out-of-range integer is REJECTED with an error, where the TS
//! implementation accepted any js-yaml number and coerced it at the engine. A
//! sweep over the published mods found a few SHIPPED ones that do use such
//! values (float defaults, uint32 ARGB colors); rather than relax the rule
//! globally, `workarounds::apply_settings_workarounds` rewrites those exact (mod
//! id, version) blocks to the value the mod actually uses (e.g. `1.0` -> `1`),
//! so a future release of the mod is forced to author it cleanly. The general
//! yaml-rust2-vs-js-yaml quoted-scalar divergences it also found
//! (surrogate-pair `\u` escapes, multi-line double-quoted indentation) are
//! handled the same per-version way. These shims are for ALREADY-PUBLISHED
//! store versions only: the engine path gates them by mod origin
//! (`extract_initial_settings_for_engine`'s `apply_workarounds`), off for a
//! locally-authored mod (`local@` storage id) so its author sees the real
//! validation error, not a silent fixup of a shipped version's source. The one
//! escape hatch is the `$float: true` annotation, which lifts the rule for that
//! item alone: the number (integer or float literal, finite) is parsed into its
//! canonical decimal text and carried as a STRING setting the mod reads with
//! `Wh_GetStringSetting`. A number item (integer or `$float`) may also declare
//! `$min` / `$max` bounds, checked against its default here and enforced by
//! the editor and the CLI, never by the store. Any item may declare `$showIf`
//! / `$hideIf`, the settings and values under which the editor shows it: the
//! validator checks the shape, and `conditions` resolves each reference,
//! written relative to the item, to the named setting's absolute declaration
//! path, checks the values against that setting, and rejects a cycle. The
//! engine never sees the conditions: a hidden setting is stored and read like
//! any other. Every one of these keys fails the parse of a Windhawk before
//! it, so each has a second spelling that older core reads as a comment: a
//! line beginning with `#! ` is read without the marker (`marker`), and a
//! block carrying one is also read as written and compared, so the marker can
//! only ever add an annotation. A `$float` default may be a string holding
//! the number (`"0.85"`), which is what a marked `$float` needs: the older
//! core stores it as the string it is. The annotation grammar is `$format`,
//! `$float`, `$dynamicSelect`, `$min`, `$max`, `$showIf`, `$hideIf`, none with
//! a language suffix, and the marker.
//!
//! Other known divergences from the TS implementation, accepted and
//! re-examined against the published mods:
//! - YAML syntax-error and schema-violation messages differ in wording
//!   (js-yaml/jsonschema diagnostics vs ours); the canonical
//!   "Failed to parse settings: not a valid YAML array" is preserved (the
//!   prefix comes from `SettingsParseError`'s `Display`, which is the one
//!   place that carries it, so no producer here spells it out).
//!   Message wording is explicitly not a compatibility concern.
//! - Scalar resolution (yaml-rust2's YAML 1.2 core schema) matches
//!   js-yaml's for everything that occurs in practice: capitalized
//!   booleans (`TRUE`/`True` -> boolean, which several published mods
//!   rely on - js-yaml's bool type accepts the three-case spellings too),
//!   `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` as strings, and decimal/hex/octal integers.
//!   The two differ only on YAML-1.1-style literals js-yaml still accepts
//!   (binary `0b...`, a number there but a string here, and capitalized
//!   `Null`/`NULL`), which do not appear in real settings and are not
//!   pursued.
//! - A block whose YAML aliases expand past a node bound is REFUSED
//!   (`aliases`), where js-yaml shares an aliased node by reference and parses
//!   it for free. No published block uses an alias at all.
//! - A block that nests past a depth bound is REFUSED (`nesting`), where the
//!   reference has no such limit. The deepest published block nests 15 levels.
//!
//! Duplicate mapping keys ARE rejected, matching js-yaml: yaml-rust2's loader
//! errors on them (the reason it is preferred over saphyr, which silently keeps
//! the last value).
//!
//! Duplicate settings IDS - two sibling items in one settings array sharing a
//! parameter key, so both flatten to the same engine name - are also rejected
//! (`validate::reject_duplicate_ids`). This is a STRICTER rule than the
//! reference, which silently collapses them last-write-wins (in the engine
//! store and the TS object); the ambiguous settings are invalid. One shipped
//! version relied on it (scroll-window-opacity 1.0.3, a malformed `modifierKey`
//! dropdown), pinned in `workarounds::apply_settings_workarounds` the same
//! per-(mod id, version) way; its engine flatten stays byte-identical.
//!
//! A settings item whose `$options[:lang]` variants do not offer the SAME set of
//! option VALUES is rejected (`validate::reject_mismatched_option_languages`).
//! Localization translates the LABELS; the value is what a selection stores and
//! what the mod reads back, so a language-dependent value set would store a
//! value the other languages cannot render and the mod does not handle. Option
//! ORDER may still differ per language. A STRICTER rule than the reference,
//! which validates each list on its own; NO shipped version violates it, so it
//! needs no `workarounds` pin.
//!
//! Object arrays whose groups declare a key their TEMPLATE group does not - or
//! with a conflicting type - are rejected
//! (`validate::reject_incompatible_object_arrays`, a post-transform pass on the
//! typed tree). The settings UI takes an object array's whole schema from the
//! first element at the template path (`items[0]`, `items[0].subItems[0]`, ...)
//! and applies it to every row, so such a key is dead in the form and mistyped
//! in the store. A reordered or partial (subset) default row stays valid - only
//! an extra or type-conflicting key is rejected. Another STRICTER-than-reference
//! rule; NO shipped version violates it, so it needs no `workarounds` pin.
