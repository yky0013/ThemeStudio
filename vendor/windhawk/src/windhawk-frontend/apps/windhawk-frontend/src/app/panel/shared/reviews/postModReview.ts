/**
 * The one request the reviews feature makes with a body: a review or a reply,
 * posted from the webview (or the website) straight to the update server's
 * moderated endpoint. It lands as pending and appears in the mod's document
 * once approved and deployed; nothing here echoes it locally.
 *
 * The request carries no credentials: the endpoint is unauthenticated, and a
 * credential-free request is what lets the server answer the cross-origin
 * preflight with a plain allow-origin header for the app's origins.
